## Quick talk about Cloud Security


---
### Quick Definition

> Cloud security is the set of cybersecurity measures used to protect cloud-based applications, data, and infrastructure. 
> 
> [https://cloud.google.com/learn/what-is-cloud-security](https://cloud.google.com/learn/what-is-cloud-security#section-2)

### Now on CloudSec

### Base solutions for Cloud Security

- CSPM:  Cloud Security Posture Management
- CWPP:  Cloud Workload Protection Platform
- CIEM:  Cloud Infrastructure Entitlements Management

<!-- .slide: data-background="./img/titles.png"; -->
## The value of the low-hanging fruits (thx h1)


---
### A few years ago ...

- Automated tools to detect miss-configuration and made the takeover <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- In scope, but who is the owner? <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Leaks <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Mergers and Acquisitions (M&A) <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- log4j u.u <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->


---
<!-- .slide: data-background="./img/titles.png"; -->
## Do it yourself (DIY) and made your own tools


---
### Fight fire with fire

- Most of cloud tools are not custom-made, unless its yours <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Challenging and will not be for everyone <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Dev + SEC + Ops <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Cloud Security Reviews <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- The gap between security team capacity and cloud security needs is huge <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->


#### Cloud security;  <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> **Self Service**  <!-- .element: class="fragment highlight-blue" --> and **Flexible**?  <!-- .element: class="fragment highlight-blue" -->


---
### Cloud Security is a team game: Key players

- GRC (Governance, Risk, Compliance)
- Vulnerability Management
- Security Operations
- IAM
- DevOps
- Dev teams with Security Champions


---
<!-- .slide: data-background="./img/titles.png"; -->
## Cloud Security Engineering


---
### Infrastructure as Code

- AWS CloudFormation, Azure Resource Manager, Google Cloud Deployment Manager
- Cloud Agnostic
  - Terraform ‚≠ê
  - Pulumi
  - Crossplane
  - OpenTofu üëÄ


---
### Use the Security stone on Iac?

![pikachu and the thunderstone](./img/pikachu-thunderstone.jpg)


---
### What? IaC is evolving!

- Unit, Contract, Integration testing (terraform)
![tf testing](./img/terraform-module_testing.webp)

- Compliance as Code (https://terraform-compliance.com/)
  - Policy as Code
- Secure Infrastructure as Code
  - Security as Code


---
### Event-Driven Architecture

> An event-driven architecture uses events to trigger and communicate between decoupled services and is common in modern applications built with microservices.

### Cloud Native

> Cloud native technologies empower organizations to build and run scalable applications in modern, dynamic environments such as public, private, and hybrid clouds. Containers, service meshes, microservices, immutable infrastructure, and declarative APIs exemplify this approach.

### Secure baseline configurator for AWS Accounts, GCP Projects, Azure Subscriptions

- Configure roles for security services (remediation, monitoring, operations, etc)
- GitOps; control infra changes from code
- Onboarding and offboarding!
- Cloud-Agnostic Approach
- **Remember:** Account level configuration (MFA, Logs, Costs, IAM, etc)


---
### Tag Enforcement

- Hey CFO!
- Service Catalog
- How many days should you wait for a team to tag their assets?
- Detect, notify, destroy.
- REALLY, DESTROY!<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- But first, a backup. Then is time to nuke <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->


---
### Majordomo

- First Point of Contact.
- More GitOps
- Trusted source
- Distribution lists
- Communication channels (slack, opsgenie, etc)
- Alerts and notifications
